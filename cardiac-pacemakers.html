        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">ðŸ“ˆ Evolution & Types of Cardiac Pacemakers</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
          The evolution of pacemakers represents a remarkable journey from bulky external devices to compact, implantable technologies. Initially, pacemakers were external systems introduced in the early 20th century, often large and cumbersome. The major leap occurred in 1958 when the first implantable pacemaker was developed by Ã…ke Senning and Rune Elmqvist. Over the decades, these devices have become smarter, smaller, and more responsive to the patient's needs. Modern pacemakers not only correct bradyarrhythmias (slow heart rate) but also adapt to physiological demands, improving patient quality of life.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          <strong>Single-chamber pacemakers</strong> are designed to stimulate either the right atrium or the right ventricle, depending on the patient's arrhythmia. They are commonly used when only one chamber of the heart is affected, particularly in patients with atrial fibrillation with slow ventricular response.

        </p>

        <p class="mb-4">
          <strong>Dual-chamber pacemakers</strong> coordinate electrical impulses between both chambers, allowing for a more natural pacing rhythm. This synchronization improves cardiac efficiency and is especially useful in patients with atrioventricular block or sick sinus syndrome.

        </p>

        <p class="mb-4">
          <strong>Rate-responsive pacemakers</strong> use built-in sensors to detect motion or changes in breathing, adjusting the pacing rate to increase heart rate during exercise and slow it during rest.

        </p>

        <p class="mb-4">
          <strong>Leadless pacemakers</strong> are capsule-sized devices implanted directly into the right ventricle via a catheter, reducing the risk of lead-related complications.

        <p class="mt-4 text-sm text-teal-200">
          Each of these pacemaker types has distinct advantages and is selected based on the patientâ€™s specific cardiac condition and lifestyle needs.

      <!-- Electrical Safety -->
      <div class="bg-gradient-to-br from-gray-800 to-gray-900 text-white rounded-2xl p-6 shadow-lg mt-8">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">âš¡ Electrical Safety in Pacemakers</h2>
        <p>
          Electrical safety is foundational in pacemaker design and patient care. Since pacemakers interface directly with the heart's conduction system, even minor electrical malfunctions can lead to serious complications. One of the most important safety concerns is <strong>electromagnetic interference (EMI)</strong>, which can disrupt pacemaker function. Modern pacemakers are equipped with shielding and filters to minimize EMI impact.
        </p>
        <img src="emi.jpg" alt="EMI and Pacemaker Interference" class="mt-4 rounded-lg shadow w-full">

        <p>
          Pacemakers' leads are insulated with special biocompatible materials to prevent unintended current leakage and protect surrounding tissues. Pacemakers rely on lithium-based batteries designed to last 5â€“15 years. Safety systems monitor battery life and send alerts when replacement is due.
        </p>

        <p>
          MRI machines generate strong magnetic fields, but many modern pacemakers are <strong>MRI-conditional</strong>, meaning they can safely function during MRI scans.

        </p>

        <p class="mt-6 text-sm text-gray-300">
          Overall, pacemaker safety is maintained through smart design, advanced materials, EMI shielding, and patient monitoring.

      <!-- Regulatory Standards -->
      <div class="bg-gradient-to-br from-indigo-700 to-indigo-900 text-white rounded-2xl p-6 shadow-lg mt-8">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">ðŸ“‹ Regulatory Standards for Pacemakers</h2>
        <p>
          Pacemakers are classified as high-risk (Class III) medical devices due to their direct influence on life-sustaining functions. Regulatory bodies ensure that these devices meet stringent standards for safety, efficacy, and quality assurance. In the US, the <strong>FDA</strong> oversees pacemaker approval. In Europe, the <strong>CE</strong> mark signifies compliance with EU regulations.
        </p>
        <img src="fda-ce.jpg" alt="FDA and CE certification" class="mt-4 rounded-lg shadow w-full">

        <p>
          International standards such as <strong>ISO 14708</strong> and <strong>ISO 13485</strong> govern pacemaker manufacturing and testing. Manufacturers must engage in continuous <strong>post-market surveillance (PMS)</strong> to detect any device-related issues after implantation.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ethical oversight ensures patient safety and informed consent in device evaluation and development. Regulatory standards provide a framework that protects patients while enabling innovation.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-6 text-sm text-indigo-200">
          These standards ensure that pacemakers remain safe, effective, and reliable for patients worldwide.

      <!-- Testing & Validation -->
      <div class="bg-gradient-to-br from-purple-700 to-purple-900 text-white rounded-2xl p-6 shadow-lg mt-8">
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">ðŸ§ª Testing & Validation of Cardiac Pacemakers</h2>
        <p>
          Pacemakers undergo rigorous testing across electrical, mechanical, and biological domains to ensure patient safety and long-term performance.
        </p>

        <p>
          The validation process begins with <strong>preclinical testing</strong> involving bench-top simulations and animal models to assess stability and battery life.
          <img src="preclinical-pacemaker-testing.jpg" alt="Preclinical Pacemaker Testing" class="mt-4 rounded-lg shadow w-full">
        </p>

        <p>
          After successful preclinical validation, <strong>clinical trials</strong> begin to evaluate safety, effectiveness, and incidence of complications.
        </p>

        <p>
          Modern pacemakers rely on embedded software for sensing and pacing algorithms, which require thorough <strong>software validation</strong> through unit testing and failure-mode analysis.
        </p>

        <p>
          Post-market surveillance continues to monitor pacemaker performance in real-world settings.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-6 text-sm text-purple-200">
          Testing and validation ensure that pacemakers meet regulatory standards and adapt to patients' dynamic cardiac needs.
