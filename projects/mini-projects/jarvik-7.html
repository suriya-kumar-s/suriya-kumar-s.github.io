  <h2 class="section-header">Introduction to the Jarvik 7 Total Artificial Heart (TAH)</h2>
  <p class="section-paragraph">
    The Jarvik 7 Total Artificial Heart (TAH) is a groundbreaking medical device designed to provide life-saving support for individuals suffering from end-stage heart failure. Developed by Dr. Robert Jarvik in the 1980s, the Jarvik 7 was one of the first artificial hearts to be used in clinical settings. It is an important innovation in the field of cardiology, bridging the gap for patients awaiting a heart transplant.
    <br /><br />
    The primary function of the Jarvik 7 is to completely replace the failing ventricles of the heart, providing circulation to the body until a suitable donor heart becomes available. The heart is a pneumatically powered, mechanical device that mimics the pumping function of the human heart. Its use has been primarily in patients who are not candidates for traditional heart transplants due to their medical condition or the lack of immediate donor availability.
    <br /><br />
    <strong>Key Features of the Jarvik 7 Total Artificial Heart:</strong>
    <ul class="section-list">
      <li>Fully pneumatic power source, allowing the heart to function without a direct electrical connection.</li>
      <li>Consists of two blood pumps, each replacing one of the natural ventricles of the heart.</li>
      <li>Employs mechanical valves to ensure the proper flow of blood through the heart and body.</li>
      <li>The heart is connected to an external air compressor that drives the pumping action of the device.</li>
      <li>Used as a "bridge" to a heart transplant, often keeping patients alive for extended periods.</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    While the Jarvik 7 was revolutionary for its time, it was not without limitations. The device required continuous monitoring and adjustments, and its bulky size made it difficult for patients to lead normal lives. Despite these challenges, the Jarvik 7 represented a significant advancement in medical engineering and cardiology, providing an alternative to patients who would otherwise have had no chance of survival while awaiting a transplant.
    <br /><br />
    Today, the legacy of the Jarvik 7 lives on, paving the way for more sophisticated artificial hearts and mechanical circulatory support devices, including the development of more compact, efficient, and reliable devices that continue to improve the quality of life for patients with severe heart conditions.
    <br /><br />
    This educational project models the core principles behind the Jarvik 7 Total Artificial Heart (TAH) and offers insights into its functionality. By simplifying the complex mechanisms of the TAH, the project aims to educate individuals about the device's key components, its impact on healthcare, and the technologies that are reshaping the future of heart disease treatment.

 <!-- Explanation of the Project Section -->
<div class="content-section">
  <h2 class="section-header">Explanation of the Project</h2>
  <p class="section-paragraph">
    This educational project aims to create a simplified model of the Jarvik 7 Total Artificial Heart (TAH) to help students and enthusiasts understand its working mechanism and core components. While this model is not an exact replica of the original device, it simulates the primary functions of the heart to provide an insightful representation of how the device operates in a simplified form.
    <br /><br />
    The model we have created focuses on mimicking the key features of the Jarvik 7, such as the blood pumps, pneumatic chambers, and pressure regulation mechanisms. These components are crucial in allowing the artificial heart to mimic the circulatory actions of the human heart. Below is a breakdown of how our educational model replicates the original device's functioning:
  </p>

  <!-- Model Details -->
  <h3 class="section-subheader">Key Components and Functions</h3>
  <div class="flex justify-center gap-10">
    <div class="w-full md:w-1/3">
      <h4 class="section-subheader">Blood Pumps</h4>
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        The blood pumps are responsible for circulating blood throughout the body. In our model, we use a small motor that replicates the pumping action of the heart. This motor drives fluid through connected tubes that mimic the blood vessels, simulating the flow of blood as the heart would naturally pump.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="w-full md:w-1/3">
      <h4 class="section-subheader">Pneumatic Chambers</h4>
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        The pneumatic chambers in the Jarvik 7 are used to regulate the blood flow by simulating the function of the ventricles. In our project, we use thermacol (a type of foam) to represent these chambers. These chambers are inflated and deflated to simulate the contraction and relaxation of the ventricles, a crucial step in mimicking the heart's pumping action.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="w-full md:w-1/3">
      <h4 class="section-subheader">Pressure Regulation</h4>
      <p class="section-paragraph">
        Pressure regulation is essential to ensure that the blood is pumped at the right pressure throughout the circulatory system. Our model simulates this function with adjustable plastic tubes that allow us to control the pressure levels. These tubes are connected to the pneumatic chambers and provide the necessary force to pump the fluid (simulating blood) through the system.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- Explanation of the Model's Operation -->
  <h3 class="section-subheader">How the Model Works</h3>
  <p class="section-paragraph">
    The model operates using a simple motor-driven mechanism to pump fluid through a system of tubes that resemble blood vessels. The motor, which mimics the pumping action of the heart, is powered by an external power source. 
    <br /><br />
    The pneumatic chambers (represented by thermacol) expand and contract with the aid of the motor, which helps regulate the pressure within the system. This mimics the contraction and relaxation of the ventricles during the heart's pumping cycle. The pressure regulation tubes ensure that the fluid is moved with the correct force, simulating the heart’s ability to maintain blood pressure throughout the body.
    <br /><br />
    The model uses basic materials such as plastic tubes, thermacol, and a small motor to demonstrate the core principles of the Jarvik 7 Total Artificial Heart. While this educational tool is not a working prototype of the actual heart, it provides a simplified visualization of how the device mimics natural heart function and circulates blood within the body.

  <h3 class="section-subheader">Educational Purpose</h3>
  <p class="section-paragraph">
    The primary goal of this project is to educate individuals about the complex mechanisms behind the Jarvik 7 artificial heart and similar medical devices. The model provides an approachable way to understand the principles of mechanical circulatory support and how it helps sustain patients with severe heart conditions.
    <br /><br />
    Through this simplified model, we aim to create an engaging learning experience for students, professionals, and anyone interested in medical technologies. By breaking down the functions of the heart into easier-to-understand concepts, we hope to inspire further interest and development in artificial heart technologies and other life-saving medical devices.

  <h3 class="section-subheader">Key Differences</h3>
  <p class="section-paragraph">
    While our educational model accurately represents the fundamental functioning of the Jarvik 7 Total Artificial Heart, there are several key differences between the real components and our simplified version:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Blood Pump Mechanism:</strong> The real device uses highly advanced pneumatically powered pumps, while our model uses a small motor for fluid circulation.</li>
      <li><strong>Pneumatic Chambers:</strong> In the real device, the chambers are specifically engineered to expand and contract under controlled pressure, while we use thermacol (foam) to represent these chambers in a more basic form.</li>
      <li><strong>Pressure Regulation:</strong> The Jarvik 7 employs a complex system for regulating blood pressure, whereas we use adjustable plastic tubes to control pressure in the model.</li>
      <li><strong>Power Source:</strong> The real heart uses a dedicated power system to ensure continuous operation, while our model is powered by an external power supply for demonstration purposes.</li>
      <li><strong>Fluid Simulation:</strong> The actual device circulates real blood, whereas our model uses colored fluid to demonstrate the circulation process in a safe and controlled way.</li>
    </ul>
    These differences highlight the simplified nature of our model, designed to demonstrate the key principles without replicating the full complexity of the actual Jarvik 7 TAH.
