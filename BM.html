        The <strong>Jarvik-7</strong> is a groundbreaking medical device known as the <em>first total artificial heart</em> ever implanted in a human as a permanent replacement. Developed in the early 1980s by <strong>Dr. Robert Jarvik</strong>, this device was designed to fully replace a patient's natural heart when it could no longer function properly. It represented a major advancement in both cardiovascular medicine and biomedical engineering, opening new possibilities for patients with end-stage heart failure.

        The structure of the Jarvik-7 includes <strong>two mechanical pumping chambers</strong> that mimic the heartâ€™s left and right ventricles. These chambers are made using <strong>biocompatible materials</strong>, such as polyurethane and aluminum, to reduce the risk of rejection and damage inside the human body. The system is pneumatically powered through an external console that regulates the heartbeat using compressed air. Despite its bulky external components, the device successfully demonstrated the feasibility of artificial heart implants.

        Though originally intended for long-term use, the Jarvik-7 today is primarily used as a <strong>bridge to transplantation</strong>, helping patients survive until a suitable donor heart becomes available. It has played a crucial role in advancing artificial organ technology and has inspired the development of more compact and efficient heart assist devices and newer generations of total artificial hearts.
