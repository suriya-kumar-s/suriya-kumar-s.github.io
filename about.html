      <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Hello! I'm <span class="text-white font-semibold">Suriya Kumar S</span>, currently pursuing my second year of B.Tech in <span class="text-white font-semibold">Biomedical Engineering</span> at <span class="text-white font-semibold">SRM Institute of Science and Technology</span>, Kattankulathur. I believe that one of the greatest gifts we can offer to others is knowledge—sharing what we learn, experience, and understand helps everyone grow stronger together.
      </p>

      <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        I’m someone who genuinely enjoys breaking down complex things into simple, understandable forms. Whether it's an academic concept, a tech idea, or a real-life scenario, I love finding clarity and spreading that clarity through creative means. I don’t believe in simply memorizing for the sake of marks—I believe in truly understanding things and applying them where they matter.
      </p>

      <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Apart from being a Biomedical Engineering student, I’m also a long-time learner and a passionate content creator. As a YouTuber, I explore Tamil devotional traditions and local cultures, sharing meaningful content with my audience. This hobby keeps me grounded and connected to my roots while pushing my creativity forward.
      </p>

      <p class="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Biomedical Engineering is a powerful fusion of healthcare and technology—and I’m excited to be part of this evolving space. From studying sensors and systems to exploring artificial intelligence in medicine, the journey so far has been both challenging and rewarding. I look forward to contributing meaningfully to the field, while continuing to explore, learn, and share beyond the boundaries of a textbook.
